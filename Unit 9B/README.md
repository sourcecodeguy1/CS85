Create a Web site for tracking, documenting, and managing the process of interviewing candidates for professional positions. On the main page, include a form with fields for the interviewer’s name, position, and date of interview. Also include fields for entering the candidate’s name, communication abilities, computer skills, business knowledge, and interviewer’s comments.
